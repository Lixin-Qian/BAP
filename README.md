## Setting up

### Dependency libraries:

This code is writing in Python, 

dependence on tensorflow: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow ï¼Œ

cleverhans: https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans.

and tensorflow/model-optimization:  https://github.com/tensorflow/model-optimization

### Currently supported setups

Imagine that our program does not rely on the underlying Library of a specific version, but considering the hidden modification and matching problems that version change may bring, list the version number used in the calculation. 

Python v2.7.3

Tensorflow-gpu v1.15.0

Cleverhans v3.0.1

Tensorflow-model-optimization v0.2.1

## Tutorials

To help you get started with this code, we perform the following tutorial code for example:

1. Train BAP model:
```
python cal_model.py 
```
2. Evaluate the trained model
```
python cal_acc.py 
```
The parameters within BAP have been preset in the code and can be modified as needed.
